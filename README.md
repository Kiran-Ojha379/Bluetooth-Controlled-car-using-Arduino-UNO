Bluetooth Controlled RC car â€“ Arduino

Make Bluetooth Controlled car using Arduino:
For controlling the Motors we are using an l298n motor driver.  you can also use l293d also.  I chose l298n in over l293d  because it has high power output. 
Now for running the car obviously we need a power source. So, For the power source, we are using  18650 Lithium-ion cells. 
You can also use any other battery which is listed below

How can I make my robot car Bluetooth:
Arduino Bluetooth control car is a simple robot car that can be controlled by your smartphone. This Smartphone gives a Bluetooth signal to the car and from the signal, the car works. 
For running the car wirelessly we are using the HC-05 Bluetooth module. We connect your phone with the BlueTooth module. Then the phone sends some random characters which are stated for running the car. 
In general, case, F is used for forwarding car movement.  B is used for a backward car moment. Similarly, Other characters are used for other directions which are mentioned in the Arduino code. 

Components used in the Arduino Car project: 
HC-05 Bluetooth
Arduino Uno R3 Board
L298N Motor Driver
DC Motor
18650 Battery and Holder
